	abstract = {Aims: This paper examines implementation of the 2005 federal alcohol control law in the Russian Federation. Methods: The documents on the Russian Federation federal legislation on the control of the production and turnover of ethyl alcohol, and ethyl alcohol containing products, news reports, research, and historical documents were gathered and analysed for implementation barriers. Results: Consumption of alcoholic beverages, especially spirits, has been one the most signicant public health problems in Russia for many centuries. Prior attempts to control alcohol consumption have been unsuccessful, in part due to the governments reliance on alcohol revenue, and its inability to implement creative and manageable solutions in the light of the high drinking rates. Implementation of this legislation has been a challenge in Russia because of administrative oversight, lack of organizational preparation, and corruption. Conclusions: The law discussed in this paper presented a window of opportunity to ameliorate the deteriorating health status and reverse the impending mortality crisis. However, a number of barriers presented substantial setbacks toward realization of this legislation.},
